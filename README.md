# üìä Fibonacci Sequence Generator in Java

A Java program that generates the Fibonacci sequence iteratively based on user input.

## üìã Description

This program prompts the user for a positive integer `n` and prints the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ Input validation (only positive numbers accepted)
- ‚ö° Efficient iterative implementation
- üñ®Ô∏è Clean output formatting
- üö™ Basic error handling

## üß† Algorithm Explanation

The Fibonacci sequence is calculated as:
- F‚ÇÄ = 0
- F‚ÇÅ = 1 
- F‚Çô = F‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ + F‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÇ for n > 1

The iterative approach:
1. Initializes two variables to store F‚ÇÄ and F‚ÇÅ
2. Prints these base values
3. Uses a loop to calculate subsequent terms by summing previous two numbers
4. Updates the variables in each iteration
